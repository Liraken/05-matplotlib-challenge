Help was received from Riley Capps and the TA (Manuel Eduardo Sotelo Cervantes) in debugging an error in the box plot. Ultimately, I found the issue myself, but I am grateful to them for lending me a hand with the matter. There may have been minor syntax alterations that ended up in the final draft, however, so any similarities in that cell with the `for` loop through the 4-drug subset would be due to that consultation.
